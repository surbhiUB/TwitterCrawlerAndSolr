# TwitterCrawlerAndSolr
The project involves using both Solr and the twitter API. The focus here is on tokenization and indexing,configuring Solr. Solr is used with optimal configurations for both the nature and language of the data being indexed. Used a cloud based VM hosted on Koding.com for setting up Solr.
